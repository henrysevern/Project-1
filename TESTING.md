## Code Validation
All code for HTML has been validated through validator.w3 and CSS through jigsaw.w3 and errors have been fixed.

![index.html](documentation/testing/code-validation/index-validation.png)

Few errors in index.html have been fixed - ID "menu-break" for some hr elements error was fixed by just using a overall style for all hr elements instead of an ID attribute. Stray 'a' tags were removed and the 'for' attribute on the quick book section 'amount' was changed to 'covers'.

No errors in gallery.html were found.
