# H's Catch

![Mockup](documentation/tests/mockup.png)

H's Catch is a website for a seafood restaurant based in North Wales. The site will be targeted towards people looking to dine out in Caernarfon, Wales area. The website aims to be informative with a sample menu, a section with contact details, opening times, directions and a map. With many food images within the different pages to show the type of food that will be served at this restaurant.
## Features 

The website features 3 different pages - Home, Gallery and a Competition.

### Home page
The home page features a short description, a sample menu, a quick book feature and information about the restaurant. The design is simple, easy to read and as a restaurant website, the images entice the user to scroll down. The dish options on the menu are highlighted with the description underneath to give the user quick reading (so if a certain dish isn't to the user preference, they can just read past). The quick book feature allows the user to quickly book a table without hassle of contacting the restaurant. The about section provides further details such as opening times, contact details, directions with an interactive map allowing the user to easily contact for further requests and how to locate the restaurant from various transport options.

### Gallery page
The gallery page features various images of the food served at the restaurant. The images are set up in a 'Pinterest' style for easy viewing. This page shows the user the food standard that is served at H's Catch providing more interest in booking a reservation. The idea behind this page is to entice the user into booking at the restaurant.

### Competition page 
The Competition page allows the user to enter a competition to win a free meal for two for answering a few questions. This page would be focused on bringing more users to visit the restaurant website and further providing more bookings. The terms and conditions are in a scroll box to allow for a cleaner viewing.

## Testing 

For all testing documentation, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.


### Unfixed Bugs

Navigation menu had to be dropped down due to the section collapsing at smaller screens. This was due to a javascript issue as the initial thinking was the navigation menu to collapse into a 'burger' icon. Due to poor knowlegde on javascript the navigation menu had to be dropped to view better on a mobile device.

Image file sizes could have been compressed in a lower quality to allow for quicker loading.
